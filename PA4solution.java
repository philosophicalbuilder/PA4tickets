     * At first, to me, this looks like a sliding window problem. However, on second
     * inspection,
     * it seems to be a Kadane's algorithim problem borrowing from solution to the
     * Maximum Subarray Sum problem
     * which I solved in 2023:

     * I initially thought this was a sliding window approach similar to my video:
     * Longest Consecutive Subsequence: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmlMx5IMEqE
     * However, this problem accumlates (or should accumlate) an ongoing score (or
     * sum) based on encountered letters. And, find the goal seems to be to find the
     * window where that score difference is maximized.
     * 
     * 
     * I'm pasting my from 2023 to Kadane's algorithim here for reference
